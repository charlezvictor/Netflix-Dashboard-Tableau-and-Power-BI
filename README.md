## Carrying out a Viz using both Power BI and Tableau, comparing functionality and effectiveness

So I tried an experiment by carrying out a Viz using both Power BI and Tableau, taking int considerataion ease of use, time duration and aestheic. So I'll briefly share my experience with both softwares while taking on this project.

### FUNCTIONALITY
---

In terms of functionality, I can say both have their own unique purposes, although they are genrally used for visualization, there are still certain speciifc things they could be situable for.

Power BI contains functionalities like Power Query and DAX, which Tableau doesn't have. Data cleaning has to be done prior to using Tableau. Although Tableau enables you create calaculated measures in it own unique way which is nice.

Tableau has a functionality that I haven't seen in Power BI yet. Tableau has a _"Page"_ function whereby it could enables see a dynamic viz on how a particular measure performs over time.

Power BI though seems to be more easier and intuitive than Tableau. But Tableau enables you lots of amazing things with your viz, thus more technical than Power BI

### EASE OF USE
---

Power BI for sure wins this one, as it's more user friendly, all you have to do is select your preferred visualization, then approriately select the necessary fields to create your own visualization, then do a drag and drop. In terms of formatting a certain Viz, Power BI enables you do that quickly. 

As opposed to Tableau where you'd require to create each viz on a seperate sheet, carry out your required formatting for viz to suit your own taste, do the same thing for the rest of the sheets then still create a dashboard at the end. A lot of time has to be spent to ensure the viz suits for your taste due to its technicality.

Power BI thus is much more easier to use and saves more time.

### ASTHETIC
---

While carrying out this project, in the process of creating the Map viz on Power BI, it was quite difficult to get a filled map that shows the number of movies released across  countries. I had to settle for the "Bubble" map. But in the aspect of overall outcome, I would say that Tableau gives you a more appleaing viz than Power BI, not that much significance of a difference, but Tableau has a slight edge over Power BI in terms of Asthetics in VIZ


Alright !!

That will be all for now, I'll defintely try out more projects using both softwares and keep taking notes.

In the meantime, you can interact with the Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/victor.onyeaghala/viz/NetflixDashboard_16789467013690/NETFLIXDASHBOARD)

Download the Power BI file [here](https://github.com/charlezvictor/Netflix-Dashboard-Tableau-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Netflix%20Project.pbix)

Both Dashbaords for [Tableau](https://github.com/charlezvictor/Netflix-Dashboard-Tableau-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Netflix%20Dashboard.pdf) and [Power BI](https://github.com/charlezvictor/Netflix-Dashboard-Tableau-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20Netflix%20Project.pdf) are available on pdf, just clcik on the one you'd love to see.
